          As a curious person who loves architecture and urban design,
          I admire the complexity of urban and natural environments.
          It is fascinating how every element affects the life of
          people and the living organisms through interaction with
          buildings, spaces, nature and other people.

          I have training in Architecture from my Bachelorâ€™s degree
          and recently graduated from the Master&apos;s program in
          Sustainable Urban Planning and Design program (SUPD) at KTH
          with a major in architecture.

          The master&apos;s thesis that Lamia Ahmed and I were working
          on during our last semester at the SUPD program recently
          received recognition by two awards: scholarship for the best
          degree projects in Applied Urban Design funded by Birthe &
          Per Arwidssons Stiftelse and KTH; and Student Award 2021 by
          ISOCARP.
